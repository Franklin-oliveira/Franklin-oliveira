### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<br>

#### Wanna know who am I? 

<br>

I am a Financist deeply in love with data, programming and technology. 

Everyday I learn new things about myself and always get surprised of how dedicated and persistent I can be about new challenges. Computers are a passion that I find out during my first masters degree (in Economics) and became a significant part of my job, studies and hobbies ever since.

I am constantly applying different approaches to explore and make sense of data, like Machine Learning and information visualization techniques. I am also a Deep Learning enthusiast avid to build applications with it.

I am always writing code in my job and personal projects. I build data-driven applications that range from simple tasks automation, to a complete web environment. 

I also have experience in Machine Learning projects applying classification models in predictive maintenance field, specially Gradient Boosting Decision Trees.

Currently I'm a masters student in Applied Mathematics at FundaÃ§Ã£o GetÃºlio Vargas in Rio de Janeiro and work as a part time researcher at the Center for Regulatory and Infrastructure Studies in the same institution. 

When I'm not studying or working, I'm playing games, hanging out with my girlfriend, listening to good music, meditating or just living the moment. :)
